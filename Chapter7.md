# Chapter 7 - Advanced Techniques

We'll cover these subjects with Wilken:

1. Using Sass to modify Ionic styles
2. Handle gestures and events
3. Storing persistent data
4. Platform specifics
5. Configure ionic defaults

The position taken in this chapter is that high-quality apps will require additional features beyond what is standard with Ionic.

The chapter is not a comprehensive example, as before, but rather a set of vignettes designed to illustrate each point.

We'll still clone Wilken's repo:

`git clone https://github.com/ionic-in-action/chapter7.git`

## Custom Ionic Styling

Like Bootstrap, Ionic comes with a full set of styles with useful and established default styles and colors.

However, often these standard colors broadcast that you are using default ionic styles.  This is also evident with [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/).

### Using Sass

[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets is a CSS preprocessor much in the same way that Markdown is a pre-processor for HTML.

Sass is valuable in that it provides things normal CSS doesn't have:
* variables
* nesting
* inheritance

We can access and change these built-in variables used in Ionic's Sass files, to makes changes for your app.

#### Preparing for Sass use in your project

We'll want to ensure that the project is ready to use Sass by installing a utility called `gulp`.

`npm install -g gulp`
`npm install -g gulp-sass`

Then run this:

`ionic setup sass`

While the book doesn't do a good job of making this clear, you'll want to ensure you change directory to:

`chapter7\sass` 

at this point.

Try running `npm install` once there.

Then, we can instruct ionic to use Sass:

First, navigate to the `chapter7/sass` folder, then run:

`npm install gulp` there as well.

#### Changing Ionic Styling Variable values

The variables available for modification in your project are listed here:

`chapter7/sass/www/lib/scss/_variables.scss`

Althought every update of ionic brings potential changes, the version of ionic you used
to create your project places this file in your project.  DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE DIRECTLY! Just use it as a reference.

#### Modifying Ionic Sass Variables

In your project, you'll modify this file:

`chapter7/sass/scss/ionic.app.scss`

When you open this file, it should have just a few lines of Sass code in it.

```javascript
// The path for our ionicons font files, relative to the built CSS in www/css
$ionicons-font-path: "../lib/ionic/fonts" !default;

//MAKE YOUR CUSTOM OVERRIDES HERE

// Include all of Ionic
@import "www/lib/ionic/scss/ionic";
```

In the example from the chapter, this is what the `ionic.app.scss` file looks like:

```javascript
/*
To customize the look and feel of Ionic, you can override the variables
in ionic's _variables.scss file.

For example, you might change some of the default colors:

$light:                           #fff !default;
$stable:                          #f8f8f8 !default;
$positive:                        #387ef5 !default;
$calm:                            #11c1f3 !default;
$balanced:                        #33cd5f !default;
$energized:                       #ffc900 !default;
$assertive:                       #ef473a !default;
$royal:                           #886aea !default;
$dark:                            #444 !default;
*/

// The path for our ionicons font files, relative to the built CSS in www/css
$ionicons-font-path: "../lib/ionic/fonts" !default;

$light: #FAFAFA;
$stable: #EEE;
$positive: #3F51B5;
$calm: #2196F3;
$balanced: #4CAF50;
$energized: #FFC107;
$assertive: #F44336;
$royal: #9C27B0;
$dark: #333;

// Include all of Ionic
@import "www/lib/ionic/scss/ionic";

@import "www/scss/app";
```

This gives a good indication of what is possible in the SCSS file.

#### Regenerating the CSS

We need need to use gulp to regenerate the CSS from the SCSS file.

`gulp sass`

# WARNING

At this stage, there are some real problems with this SASS tool, NodeJS and Ionic.

These problems are described here:

[https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/error-running-gulp-sass/32311/31](https://forum.ionicframework.com/t/error-running-gulp-sass/32311/31)

[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32552499/error-running-gulp-sass](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32552499/error-running-gulp-sass)

We'll just have to leave this alone for now.

In general, this is due to the fact that node has changed quite a bit in the last 2 years.

#Detecting if the Device is Offline or Online

You may want to detect your app is offline and react accordingly.

We can either use:

* A cordova plugin
* Listen for online/offline events

The browser (user agent) will help:

`chapter7/offline/www/js/app.js`

```javascript
angular.module('App', ['ionic'])
.run(function($rootScope, $window) {

  alert($window.navigator.onLine);

  $window.addEventListener('offline', function() {
    alert('offline');
    $rootScope.$digest();
  });

  $window.addEventListener('online', function() {
    alert('online');
    $rootScope.$digest();
  });

})
```

## Handling Gestures

We handle gestures and other unique UI interactions two ways in Ionic:

1. Built-in directives used to listen for events
2. Adding event listeners programmatically

### Directives

These are built-in directives that listen for a particular event and call an expression or function.

Events:

* Hold
* Tap
* Drag
* Swipe

#### Events sub-directory

Go to the `chapter7\events` subdirectory and run it.

`ionic serve -p $PORT --nolivereload`

You can see a box icon that you drag around with your finger.

Here is the code that creates the custom directive for the module:

```javascript
.directive('box', function () {
  return {
    restrict: 'E',
    link: function (scope, element) {
      var time = 0, boxX = 0, boxY = 0;
      var leftBound = window.innerWidth - 50;
      var bottomBound = window.innerHeight - 50;
      scope.top = 0;
      scope.left = 0;
      
      scope.startTouch = function (event) {
        time = event.timeStamp;
      };
      scope.endTouch = function (event) {
        console.log('You held the box for ' + (event.timeStamp - time) + 'ms');
        boxX = scope.left;
        boxY = scope.top;
      };
      scope.drag = function (event) {
        var left = boxX + Math.round(event.gesture.deltaX);
        var top = boxY + Math.round(event.gesture.deltaY);

        if (left > leftBound) {
          scope.left = leftBound;
        } else if (left < 0) {
          scope.left = 0;
        } else {
          scope.left = left;
        }
        if (top > bottomBound) {
          scope.top = bottomBound;
        } else if (top < 0) {
          scope.top = 0;
        } else {
          scope.top = top;
        }
      };
    },
    template: '<div id="box" class="icon ion-cube" on-touch="startTouch($event)" on-release="endTouch($event)" on-drag="drag($event)" ng-style="{top: top + \'px\', left: left + \'px\'}"></div>'
  }
})

```

And here is the directive in use:

```html
  <body ng-app="App">
    <box></box>
  </body>
```

The box moves around due to css:

```css
#box {
  position: absolute;
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  font-size: 50px;
  text-align: center;
}
```

### Programmatic Event Handling for Gestures

We can also use the `$ionicGesture` service.

Go to `chapter7/gestures`

We inject `$ionicGesture` into your controller and then declare which events to listen to.

We also specify which element we'll be listening to.  Thus, we should prefer using directives
as directives are best when we need to manipulate the DOM in our templates.

The example supposes that we have a card we want to swipe in our UI.
