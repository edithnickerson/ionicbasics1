# Chapter Challenges

Don't forget to upload your app to the ionic platform when you are done:

`ionic upload`

1. Reload the forecast - `ionRefresher`
    2. Completed - `ionRefresher` used [http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionRefresher/](http://ionicframework.com/docs/api/directive/ionRefresher/)
2. Implement the loading component - use `$ionicLoading` like in chapter 4
    2. Completed for the weather service
3. Allow reordering of locations - `ionList` reordering
4. Use tabs instead of scrolling - Avoid making each tab a new state
5. Set Default view - set to primary location once loocations are stored
    6. Completed - had a look here to help: https://docs.angularjs.org/guide/providers
6. Persistence - Since this will be covered in chapter 7, let's skip it.
